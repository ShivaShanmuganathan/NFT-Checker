# NFT-Checker
Check OpenSea and Rarible for duplicates


NFT-Checker is a dapp that checks OpenSea, Rarible and other NFT marketplaces and runs a search / anomaly detection algorithm for an NFT (example Stoner Cats, which is currently only on resale for OpenSea and Rarible). This would ensure that users are buying real and not fraudulent NFTs.
